                blurb: 'The painting was made with a technique called "glazing." I have seldom used this style because "California Style" painting uses much more intense, saturated pigment. I love using the softer colors which are achieved by applying very delicate washes of pure color (yellow, red, or blue). As the light comes through the colors from the white paper it makes the color look (like stained glass) instead of mixing colors first then applying, the color gets "mixed" by the light.',
